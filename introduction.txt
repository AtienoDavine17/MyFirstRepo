Brief Introduction About Myself
My name is Atieno Davine, I am 22 years old.
Iâ€™m a curious and emotionally intelligent learner who enjoys diving deep into problems and finding thoughtful solutions. 
I tend to overthink (in a good way!) and love connecting with others who are passionate about building, breaking, and improving things. Always open to collaborations and conversations,feel free to reach out!
