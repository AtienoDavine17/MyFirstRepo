I've learned how to navigate the terminal confidently—moving between directories with cd, listing files with ls, and checking my current path with pwd. I can now create files (touch), copy and move them (cp, mv), and even delete them carefully (rm).I’ve also started understanding file permissions (chmod) and how to read them (ls -l). Editing files in nano feels less intimidating now, and I’ve even written a simple shell script! The man command has been a lifesaver for looking up syntax. Next, I’m excited to dive into piping (|) and grep for text processing!
I'm starting to feel more comfortable in the terminal—I can navigate directories, manage files, and even tweak permissions. On the Git side, I’ve got the basics down: creating repos, staging changes, and committing with (hopefully) clear messages. I’ve pushed my first project to GitHub and cloned a repo, which felt like a milestone! But I still mix up when to use git pull vs. git fetch, and branching (git branch) still feels a little mysterious. Next, I want to tackle merging conflicts and maybe even rebasing. The learning curve is steep, but it’s satisfying when commands finally click!
